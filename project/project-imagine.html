      I was hired as Service Designer to kickstart the process of creating their
       native app. This new, engaging and difficult problem required me to continuously
        present my research, wireframes and IA plans to a growing multi-disciplinary team.

      A near daily occurence: communicating and discussing the latest thinking on
      the information architecture and discovery models.

      The job was to create a “second-generation” challenger bank and wealth management
       platform. It’s USP was granting access to high return products based on “good
       financial behaviour” and not on one’s net worth.
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text">
      One major discovery from my research was the changing definitions of “good
       behaviour” depending on where a person was in their financial life.

      Working across a range of customer segments, we went from conceptual financial
       product to pixel-perfect prototype including some pretty sophisticated interaction
        design in 6 weeks.
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text">
      The project is in continuous development under the trading name, Dozens.
