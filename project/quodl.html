      University lecturers have very few tools that are specifically designed for
      the lecture theatre. The client, a senior lecturer in psychology had developed
      a text service that he used to quiz the students and develop their retrieval
      practice (the ability to recall facts from memory). There were issues with
      adoption, however, from students, lecturers, and university administrators.
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text">
      I designed a simple web app that would allow students to login and instantly
      find the quiz that was being run live in the lecture while giving the lecturer
      full control over the pacing of the quizes. The app also featured various
      kinds of gamification - rewards, scores, and a leaderboard. The UI was fun
      and made to be unlike anything on the market today, somewhere between a
      video game and a learning platform.

    <p class="section__project-text">
      Some time after its release I was asked to update the UI as part of a
      commercialisation effort to make the product more palatable to potential
      investors.

    <p class="section__project-text">
      In addition, more work was needed on some of the gamification
      aspects. I designed a website and achievement badges that a UI designer,
      whom I instructed, converted in to assets for the web.
