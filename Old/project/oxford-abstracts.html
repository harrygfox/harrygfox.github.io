  <!-- DETAILS OF THE PROJECT -->

  <section class="section">

    <p class="section__project-text">
      Oxford Abstracts offers the full-suite of conference management services.
      The job of managing a conference (or other similar event)
     is complicated and separated across a variety of places - some digital, some
     physical.

    <p class="section__project-text">
      Additionally, there is the task of organising the various groups
      of people involved: submitters (sometimes organised into symposia),
      submission-reviewers, decision makers (often organised into committees)
      and reminding them of their duties and deadlines. Many of these jobs can
      be streamlined or performed infinitely faster by a computer.
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text">
      Working in agile sprints, I began with a ‘submission form builder’ and a
      responsive submission form to support submission updates from any device.
      This was to be the core of the project.

    <p class="section__project-text">
      Beyond this, the complexity of the tasks elevated to include features like
      multi-stage conferences, an online-programme for each event, and even bulk-assigning
      submissions to multiple reviewers based on their self-determined category -
      a job which requires the user, a conference administrator, to have a view of
      every piece of data associated with the submissions and reviewers, in an
      order of their choosing... simultaneously.

    <p class="section__project-text">
      Sprint-based design   in a complex system requires quickly picking
      up a deep knowledge of the processes and rapidly prototyping to find and
      test solutions in as short a period of time as possible. This has involved
      user testing remotely as well as travelling to offices around the country
      to demonstrate to and quiz the users on their personal gripes with their
      current solutions and how they could be improved.
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text">
      In addition to the design work (which included an interactive styleguide)
      I was responsible for building the front-end for a large proportion of the
      interfaces. This involved using various technologies including HTML,
      Handlebars, Elm, CSS and Sass.

      Since release the feedback has been generally positive. One review came
      from an administrator at the National Council on Family Relations who said:
    </p>
    <p class="section__project-text section__project-text--quote">
        “This new system is wonderful. Our people will love it. It is great that
        they can sign in and go directly to the form. It is a comprehensive
        system which can be complex, but except for the few questions I had, it
        was easy to set up. Even though it could be complex, the system is so
        user-friendly (after all I was able to do everything myself - and I am
        basically a self-taught, 75 year old lady, and if I can figure it out, it
        is a great system).”
